# TerminalTeacher Typescript

Learn the terminal with Banzi the gorilla! This project aims to provide a teaching assistant for those learning the Unix terminal. It was created as part of a web programming class and was originally implemented in JavaScript. I've reimplemented it in Typescript with a cleaner design.
